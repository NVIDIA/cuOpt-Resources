    "The cost matrix and the waypoint graph are two environment representations for the NVIDIA cuOpt Managed Service. Each one encapsulates user-defined costs of transitioning from one state or location to another within an optimization problem. cuOpt uses this environment representation to evaluate solution quality while minimizing the total cost.\n",

    "The selection hinges on your data availability and use case specifics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Matrices :** Choose a cost matrix when your primary focus is the cost between target locations, such as orders, jobs, or vehicles. This method is common in applications reliant on map data, where cost values between required points is either known or easily calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Waypoint Graph :** Choose a waypoint graph when your data is portrayed as a network where a subset of nodes represent target locations and others are only being traversed (not acted upon by vehicles or agents, and lack associated orders or jobs). This approach is common in custom environments and indoor locations like warehouses and factories where the cost between target locations is dynamic or not easily calculated."

The matrix's rows and columns correspond to different nodes in the routing problem, with each entry showing the cost of transitioning from one point to another. The \"cost\" can encapsulate a range of metrics, from monetary values to distance, time, or energy. This matrix serves an important function allowing cuOpt to compute the optimal route (minimize the total cost)."
